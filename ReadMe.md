## What was the Assignment?
Ruby Games provided a list of mechanics and requested that I create a unique game incorporating at least two mechanics from that list. I chose the *Stacking* and *Merge* mechanics.

## What is this game?
This is a basic game created over a weekend as part of a case study provided by **Ruby Games**.
- The objective is to *Stack and Merge* boxes in order to reach specific color-based thresholds and complete the levels.
- The art is not of my own creation; the majority of it comes from various asset packs.
